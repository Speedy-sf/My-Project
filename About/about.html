<div class="container5"><p><strong>The year is now 2008.</strong> A few of us guys are hanging out; playing CoD, eating pizza, listening to T-Pain…You know…Gaming and grinding! Matches are won and lost. The hours fly by. Our eyes are beginning to tire. The pizza adrenaline is wearing off. Our hands are aching. We turn to the only thing we know capable of helping us in such a crisis – A case of sugar-filled energy drinks! We grab em’, crack em’ open, and down em’ like our lives depended on it! We then felt a sudden rush of energy! Our lifeblood had been restored! “Let the grind commence!” we said! But then, without any warning…we crashed! The energy we once had was now gone! The grind was no more! Our huddled bodies lie helplessly on the living room floor…<strong>It was an energy drink crash…</strong></p></div>
<br>
<div class="container6"><p><strong>The year is now 2012…</strong>The crash was so intense, it took 4 years off of our lives. We decided to have a meeting – A meeting that would soon change the course of energy drinks as we once knew them! “There must be another way! There must be a better way! We must find the way!!!” we said! And so we did! With months of unrelenting research, top-secret experiments, and the application of advanced mathematics and science – We had, in one full scoop, created The Energy Drink of Tomorrow, The Official Energy Drink of eSports, AND The Original Energy Formula of Gaming! What we created was <strong>G FUEL ENERGY FORMULA!</strong></p></div>
